    content: "Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification beyond just a password.",

    title: "Use a Password Manager",
    content: "Password managers help you generate, store, and manage strong, unique passwords for all your accounts in one secure location.",

    category: "phishing",
    title: "Recognize Social Engineering",
    content: "Be aware of social engineering tactics that manipulate people into revealing sensitive information or performing actions.",
